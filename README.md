# shoestring-2020

## Setup

`flask` should come with Python already by default. If not,
use `pip3` or something to install them.

We also need `TensorFlow` and `Keras`. Install them using your
favourite package manager. For example,

```shell script
pip3 install tensorflow keras
```

For JavaScript:

```shell script
npm install
```

## Running

First run the Python backend in a terminal:

```shell script
python3 chatbot.py
```

Next run the frontend in another terminal (I have used React here):

```shell script
npm start
```

Right now nothing much is happening, there is just one dummy request.
