# shoestring-2020

## Setup

`flask` and `pickle` should come with Python already by default. If not,
use `pip3` or something to install them.

JavaScript:

```shell script
npm install
```

## Running

First run the Python backend in a terminal:

```shell script
python3 chatbot.py
```

Next run the frontend in another terminal (I have used React here):

```shell script
npm start
```

Right now nothing much is happening, there is just one dummy request.
